# tic-tac-toe

I built this Tic-Tac-Toe Game to enhance my Javascript skills. Feel free to play it if you and your friends are bored and you like to play a good-looking version of the game. 
You can find the project [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe 'The Odin Project').
